    "\n",
    "Last week we considered the motion of a falling object with air\n",
    "resistance. Here we look at both a quadratic in velocity resistance\n",
    "and linear in velocity.  But first we give a qualitative argument\n",
    "about the mathematical expression for the air resistance we used last\n",
    "Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Air resistance tends to scale as the square of the velocity. This is\n",
    "in contrast to many problems chosen for textbooks, where it is linear\n",
    "in the velocity. The choice of a linear dependence is motivated by\n",
    "mathematical simplicity (it keeps the differential equation linear)\n",
    "rather than by physics. One can see that the force should be quadratic\n",
    "in velocity by considering the momentum imparted on the air\n",
    "molecules. If an object sweeps through a volume $dV$ of air in time\n",
