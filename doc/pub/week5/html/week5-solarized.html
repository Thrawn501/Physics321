<h2 id="air-resistance-in-one-dimension">Air Resistance in One Dimension </h2>

<p>
Last week we considered the motion of a falling object with air
resistance. Here we look at both a quadratic in velocity resistance
and linear in velocity.  But first we give a qualitative argument
about the mathematical expression for the air resistance we used last
Friday.

<p>
Air resistance tends to scale as the square of the velocity. This is
in contrast to many problems chosen for textbooks, where it is linear
in the velocity. The choice of a linear dependence is motivated by
mathematical simplicity (it keeps the differential equation linear)
rather than by physics. One can see that the force should be quadratic
in velocity by considering the momentum imparted on the air
molecules. If an object sweeps through a volume \( dV \) of air in time
\( dt \), the momentum imparted on the air is

$$
\begin{equation}
dP=\rho_m dV v,
\label{_auto1}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where \( v \) is the velocity of the object and \( \rho_m \) is the mass
density of the air. If the molecules bounce back as opposed to stop
you would double the size of the term. The opposite value of the
momentum is imparted onto the object itself. Geometrically, the
differential volume is

$$
\begin{equation}
dV=Avdt,
\label{_auto2}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area and \( vdt \) is the distance the
object moved in time \( dt \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="resulting-acceleration">Resulting Acceleration </h2>
Plugging this into the expression above,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt}=-\rho_m A v^2.
\label{_auto3}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
This is the force felt by the particle, and is opposite to its
direction of motion. Now, because air doesn't stop when it hits an
object, but flows around the best it can, the actual force is reduced
by a dimensionless factor \( c_W \), called the drag coefficient.

$$
\begin{equation}
F_{\rm drag}=-c_W\rho_m Av^2,
\label{_auto4}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
and the acceleration is

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{c_W\rho_mA}{m}v^2.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
For a particle with initial velocity \( v_0 \), one can separate the \( dt \)
to one side of the equation, and move everything with $v$s to the
other side. We did this in our discussion of simple motion and will not repeat it here.

<p>
On more general terms,
for many systems, e.g. an automobile, there are multiple sources of
resistance. In addition to wind resistance, where the force is
proportional to \( v^2 \), there are dissipative effects of the tires on
the pavement, and in the axel and drive train. These other forces can
have components that scale proportional to \( v \), and components that
are independent of \( v \). Those independent of \( v \), e.g. the usual
\( f=\mu_K N \) frictional force you consider in your first Physics courses, only set in
once the object is actually moving. As speeds become higher, the \( v^2 \)
components begin to dominate relative to the others. For automobiles
at freeway speeds, the \( v^2 \) terms are largely responsible for the
loss of efficiency. To travel a distance \( L \) at fixed speed \( v \), the
energy/work required to overcome the dissipative forces are \( fL \),
which for a force of the form \( f=\alpha v^n \) becomes
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
W=\int dx~f=\alpha v^n L.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

For \( n=0 \) the work is
independent of speed, but for the wind resistance, where \( n=2 \),
slowing down is essential if one wishes to reduce fuel consumption. It
is also important to consider that engines are designed to be most
efficient at a chosen range of power output. Thus, some cars will get
better mileage at higher speeds (They perform better at 50 mph than at
5 mph) despite the considerations mentioned above.

<h2 id="going-ballistic-projectile-motion-or-a-softer-approach-falling-raindrops">Going Ballistic, Projectile Motion or a Softer Approach, Falling Raindrops </h2>

<p>
As an example of Newton's Laws we consider projectile motion (or a
falling raindrop or a ball we throw up in the air) with a drag force. Even though air resistance is
largely proportional to the square of the velocity, we will consider
the drag force to be linear to the velocity, \( \boldsymbol{F}=-m\gamma\boldsymbol{v} \),
for the purposes of this exercise.

<p>
Such a dependence can be extracted from experimental data for objects moving at low velocities, see for example Malthe-S&#248;renssen chapter 5.6.

<p>
We will here focus on a two-dimensional problem.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="two-dimensional-falling-object">Two-dimensional falling object </h2>

<p>
The acceleration for a projectile moving upwards,
\( \boldsymbol{a}=\boldsymbol{F}/m \), becomes

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dv_x}{dt}=-\gamma v_x,\\
\nonumber
\frac{dv_y}{dt}=-\gamma v_y-g,
\end{eqnarray}
$$

and \( \gamma \) has dimensions of inverse time.

<p>
If you on the other hand have a falling raindrop, how do these equations change? See for example Figure 2.1 in Taylor.
Let us stay with a ball which is thrown up in the air at \( t=0 \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="ways-of-solving-these-equations">Ways of solving these equations </h2>

<p>
We will go over two different ways to solve this equation. The first
by direct integration, and the second as a differential equation. To
do this by direct integration, one simply multiplies both sides of the
equations above by \( dt \), then divide by the appropriate factors so
that the $v$s are all on one side of the equation and the \( dt \) is on
the other. For the \( x \) motion one finds an easily integrable equation,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dv_x}{v_x}&=&-\gamma dt,\\
\nonumber
\int_{v_{0x}}^{v_{x}}\frac{dv_x}{v_x}&=&-\gamma\int_0^{t}dt,\\
\nonumber
\ln\left(\frac{v_{x}}{v_{0x}}\right)&=&-\gamma t,\\
\nonumber
v_{x}(t)&=&v_{0x}e^{-\gamma t}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
This is very much the result you would have written down
by inspection. For the \( y \)-component of the velocity,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dv_y}{v_y+g/\gamma}&=&-\gamma dt\\
\nonumber
\ln\left(\frac{v_{y}+g/\gamma}{v_{0y}-g/\gamma}\right)&=&-\gamma t_f,\\
\nonumber
v_{fy}&=&-\frac{g}{\gamma}+\left(v_{0y}+\frac{g}{\gamma}\right)e^{-\gamma t}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
Whereas \( v_x \) starts at some value and decays
exponentially to zero, \( v_y \) decays exponentially to the terminal
velocity, \( v_t=-g/\gamma \).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="solving-as-differential-equations">Solving as differential equations </h2>

<p>
Although this direct integration is simpler than the method we invoke
below, the method below will come in useful for some slightly more
difficult differential equations in the future. The differential
equation for \( v_x \) is straight-forward to solve. Because it is first
order there is one arbitrary constant, \( A \), and by inspection the
solution is

$$
\begin{equation}
v_x=Ae^{-\gamma t}.
\label{_auto5}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
The arbitrary constants for equations of motion are usually determined
by the initial conditions, or more generally boundary conditions. By
inspection \( A=v_{0x} \), the initial \( x \) component of the velocity.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="differential-equations-contn">Differential Equations, contn </h2>
The differential equation for \( v_y \) is a bit more complicated due to
the presence of \( g \). Differential equations where all the terms are
linearly proportional to a function, in this case \( v_y \), or to
derivatives of the function, e.g., \( v_y \), \( dv_y/dt \),
\( d^2v_y/dt^2\cdots \), are called linear differential equations. If
there are terms proportional to \( v^2 \), as would happen if the drag
force were proportional to the square of the velocity, the
differential equation is not longer linear. Because this expression
has only one derivative in \( v \) it is a first-order linear differential
equation. If a term were added proportional to \( d^2v/dt^2 \) it would be
a second-order differential equation.  In this case we have a term
completely independent of \( v \), the gravitational acceleration \( g \), and
the usual strategy is to first rewrite the equation with all the
linear terms on one side of the equal sign,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dv_y}{dt}+\gamma v_y=-g.
\label{_auto6}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="splitting-into-two-parts">Splitting into two parts </h2>

<p>
Now, the solution to the equation can be broken into two
parts. Because this is a first-order differential equation we know
that there will be one arbitrary constant. Physically, the arbitrary
constant will be determined by setting the initial velocity, though it
could be determined by setting the velocity at any given time. Like
most differential equations, solutions are not &quot;solved&quot;. Instead,
one guesses at a form, then shows the guess is correct. For these
types of equations, one first tries to find a single solution,
i.e. one with no arbitrary constants. This is called the {\it
particular} solution, \( y_p(t) \), though it should really be called
&quot;a&quot; particular solution because there are an infinite number of such
solutions. One then finds a solution to the {\it homogenous} equation,
which is the equation with zero on the right-hand side,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dv_{y,h}}{dt}+\gamma v_{y,h}=0.
\label{_auto7}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Homogenous solutions will have arbitrary constants.

<p>
The particular solution will solve the same equation as the original
general equation

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dv_{y,p}}{dt}+\gamma v_{y,p}=-g.
\label{_auto8}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
However, we don't need find one with arbitrary constants. Hence, it is
called a <b>particular</b> solution.

<p>
The sum of the two,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_y=v_{y,p}+v_{y,h},
\label{_auto9}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
is a solution of the total equation because of the linear nature of
the differential equation. One has now found a <em>general</em> solution
encompassing all solutions, because it both satisfies the general
equation (like the particular solution), and has an arbitrary constant
that can be adjusted to fit any initial condition (like the homogeneous
solution). If the equations were not linear, that is if there were terms
such as \( v_y^2 \) or \( v_y\dot{v}_y \), this technique would not work.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="more-details">More details </h2>

<p>
Returning to the example above, the homogenous solution is the same as
that for \( v_x \), because there was no gravitational acceleration in
that case,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_{y,h}=Be^{-\gamma t}.
\label{_auto10}
\end{equation}
$$

In this case a particular solution is one with constant velocity,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_{y,p}=-g/\gamma.
\label{_auto11}
\end{equation}
$$

Note that this is the terminal velocity of a particle falling from a
great height. The general solution is thus,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_y=Be^{-\gamma t}-g/\gamma,
\label{_auto12}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
and one can find \( B \) from the initial velocity,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_{0y}=B-g/\gamma,~~~B=v_{0y}+g/\gamma.
\label{_auto13}
\end{equation}
$$

Plugging in the expression for \( B \) gives the \( y \) motion given the initial velocity,

$$
\begin{equation}
v_y=(v_{0y}+g/\gamma)e^{-\gamma t}-g/\gamma.
\label{_auto14}
\end{equation}
$$

It is easy to see that this solution has \( v_y=v_{0y} \) when \( t=0 \) and
\( v_y=-g/\gamma \) when \( t\rightarrow\infty \).

<p>
One can also integrate the two equations to find the coordinates \( x \)
and \( y \) as functions of \( t \),

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
x&=&\int_0^t dt'~v_{0x}(t')=\frac{v_{0x}}{\gamma}\left(1-e^{-\gamma t}\right),\\
\nonumber
y&=&\int_0^t dt'~v_{0y}(t')=-\frac{gt}{\gamma}+\frac{v_{0y}+g/\gamma}{\gamma}\left(1-e^{-\gamma t}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
If the question was to find the position at a time \( t \), we would be
finished. However, the more common goal in a projectile equation
problem is to find the range, i.e. the distance \( x \) at which \( y \)
returns to zero. For the case without a drag force this was much
simpler. The solution for the \( y \) coordinate would have been
\( y=v_{0y}t-gt^2/2 \). One would solve for \( t \) to make \( y=0 \), which would
be \( t=2v_{0y}/g \), then plug that value for \( t \) into \( x=v_{0x}t \) to
find \( x=2v_{0x}v_{0y}/g=v_0\sin(2\theta_0)/g \). One follows the same
steps here, except that the expression for \( y(t) \) is more
complicated. Searching for the time where \( y=0 \), and we get

$$
\begin{equation}
0=-\frac{gt}{\gamma}+\frac{v_{0y}+g/\gamma}{\gamma}\left(1-e^{-\gamma t}\right).
\label{_auto15}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
This cannot be inverted into a simple expression \( t=\cdots \). Such
expressions are known as &quot;transcendental equations&quot;, and are not the
rare instance, but are the norm. In the days before computers, one
might plot the right-hand side of the above graphically as
a function of time, then find the point where it crosses zero.

<p>
Now, the most common way to solve for an equation of the above type
would be to apply Newton's method numerically. This involves the
following algorithm for finding solutions of some equation \( F(t)=0 \).

<ol>
<li> First guess a value for the time, \( t_{\rm guess} \).</li>
<li> Calculate \( F \) and its derivative, \( F(t_{\rm guess}) \) and \( F'(t_{\rm guess}) \).</li> 
<li> Unless you guessed perfectly, \( F\ne 0 \), and assuming that \( \Delta F\approx F'\Delta t \), one would choose</li> 
<li> \( \Delta t=-F(t_{\rm guess})/F'(t_{\rm guess}) \).</li>
<li> Now repeat step 1, but with \( t_{\rm guess}\rightarrow t_{\rm guess}+\Delta t \).</li>
</ol>

If the \( F(t) \) were perfectly linear in \( t \), one would find \( t \) in one
step. Instead, one typically finds a value of \( t \) that is closer to
the final answer than \( t_{\rm guess} \). One breaks the loop once one
finds \( F \) within some acceptable tolerance of zero. A program to do
this will be added shortly.

\boldsymbol{F}&=&q\boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{B},\\
\nonumber
F_i&=&q\sum_{jk}\epsilon_{ijk}v_jB_k.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
For a uniform field in the \( z \) direction \( \boldsymbol{B}=B\hat{z} \), the force can only have \( x \) and \( y \) components,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
F_x&=&qBv_y\\
\nonumber
F_y&=&-qBv_x.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
The differential equations are

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{v}_x&=&\omega_c v_y,\omega_c= qB/m\\
\nonumber
\dot{v}_y&=&-\omega_c v_x.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

One can solve the equations by taking time derivatives of either equation, then substituting into the other equation,
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot{v}_x=\omega_c\dot{v_y}=-\omega_c^2v_x,\\
\nonumber
\ddot{v}_y&=&-\omega_c\dot{v}_x=-\omega_cv_y.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
The solution to these equations can be seen by inspection,
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
v_x&=&A\sin(\omega_ct+\phi),\\
\nonumber
v_y&=&A\cos(\omega_ct+\phi).
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<p>
One can integrate the equations to find the positions as a function of time,
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
x-x_0&=&\int_{x_0}^x dx=\int_0^t dt v(t)\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{-A}{\omega_c}\cos(\omega_ct+\phi),\\
\nonumber
y-y_0&=&\frac{A}{\omega_c}\sin(\omega_ct+\phi).
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The trajectory is a circle centered at \( x_0,y_0 \) with amplitude \( A \) rotating in the clockwise direction.

<p>
The equations of motion for the \( z \) motion are
$$
\begin{equation}
\dot{v_z}=0,
\label{_auto16}
\end{equation}
$$

which leads to
$$
\begin{equation}
z-z_0=V_zt.
\label{_auto17}
\end{equation}
$$

Added onto the circle, the motion is helical.

<p>
Note that the kinetic energy,
$$
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)=\frac{1}{2}m(\omega_c^2A^2+V_z^2),
\label{_auto18}
\end{equation}
$$

is constant. This is because the force is perpendicular to the
velocity, so that in any differential time element \( dt \) the work done
on the particle \( \boldsymbol{F}\cdot{dr}=dt\boldsymbol{F}\cdot{v}=0 \).

<p>
One should think about the implications of a velocity dependent
force. Suppose one had a constant magnetic field in deep space. If a
particle came through with velocity \( v_0 \), it would undergo cyclotron
motion with radius \( R=v_0/\omega_c \). However, if it were still its
motion would remain fixed. Now, suppose an observer looked at the
particle in one reference frame where the particle was moving, then
changed their velocity so that the particle's velocity appeared to be
zero. The motion would change from circular to fixed. Is this
possible?

<p>
The solution to the puzzle above relies on understanding
relativity. Imagine that the first observer believes \( \boldsymbol{B}\ne 0 \) and
that the electric field \( \boldsymbol{E}=0 \). If the observer then changes
reference frames by accelerating to a velocity \( \boldsymbol{v} \), in the new
frame \( \boldsymbol{B} \) and \( \boldsymbol{E} \) both change. If the observer moved to the
frame where the charge, originally moving with a small velocity \( v \),
is now at rest, the new electric field is indeed \( \boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{B} \),
which then leads to the same acceleration as one had before. If the
velocity is not small compared to the speed of light, additional
\( \gamma \) factors come into play,
\( \gamma=1/\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2} \). Relativistic motion will not be
considered in this course.

<h2 id="sliding-block-tied-to-a-wall">Sliding Block tied to a Wall </h2>

<p>
Another classical case is that of simple harmonic oscillations, here
represented by a block sliding on a horizontal frictionless
surface. The block is tied to a wall with a spring. If the spring is
not compressed or stretched too far, the force on the block at a given
position \( x \) is

$$
      F=-kx.

<h2 id="back-and-forth-sliding-block-with-no-friction">Back and Forth, Sliding Block with no friction </h2>

<p>
The negative sign means that the force acts to restore the object to an equilibrium position. Newton's equation of motion for this idealized system is then 

$$
    m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kx,
  $$

or we could rephrase it as
$$
   \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\frac{k}{m}x=-\omega_0^2x,
\label{eq:newton1}
  $$

with the angular frequency \( \omega_0^2=k/m \).

<p>
We will derive the above force when we start studying <b>harmonic oscillations</b>.

<h2 id="final-rewrite">Final rewrite </h2>

<p>
With the position \( x(t) \) and the velocity  \( v(t)=dx/dt \) we can reformulate Newton's equation in the following way
$$
      \frac{dx(t)}{dt}=v(t),
  $$

  and
$$
      \frac{dv(t)}{dt}=-\omega_0^2x(t).
  $$

<p>
With initial conditions \( x(t_0)=x_0 \) and \( v(t_0)=v_0 \) we can in turn solve the differential equations.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="analytical-solution">Analytical Solution </h2>

<p>
The above differential equation has the advantage that it can be
solved analytically with general solutions on the form

$$
     x(t)=A\cos{\omega_0t}+B\sin{\omega_0t},
  $$

and

$$
     v(t)=-\omega A\sin{\omega_0t}+\omega B\cos{\omega_0t},
  $$

<p>
where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants to be determined from the initial conditions.

<p>
This provides in turn an important test for the numerical solution and
the development of a program for more complicated cases which cannot
be solved analytically.

<p>
We will discuss the above equations in more detail when we discuss harmonic oscillations.

We could also in case we can separate the degrees of freedom integrate. Take for example one of the equations in the previous slide

which we can rewrite in terms of a left-hand side which depends only on the velocity and a right-hand side which depends only on time
$$
\frac{dv_x}{v_x}=-\gamma dt.
$$

Integrating we have (since we can separate \( v_x \) and \( t \))
$$
\int_{v_0}^{v_t}\frac{dv_x}{v_x}=-\int_{t_0}^{t_f}\gamma dt,
$$

where \( v_f \) is the velocity at a final time and \( t_f \) is the final time.
In this case we found, after having integrated the above two sides that

v_f(t)=v_0\exp{-\gamma t}.

<h2 id="work-energy-momentum-and-conservation-laws">Work, Energy, Momentum and Conservation laws </h2>

<p>
The previous three cases have shown us how to use Newton&#8217;s laws of
motion to determine the motion of an object based on the forces acting
on it. For two of the cases there is an underlying assumption that we can find an analytical solution to a continuous problem.
With a continuous problem we mean a problem where the various variables can take any value within a finite or infinite interval.

<p>
Unfortunately, in many cases we
cannot find an exact solution to the equations of motion we get from
Newton&#8217;s second law. The numerical approach, where we discretize the continuous problem, allows us however to study a much richer set of problems.
For problems involving Newton's laws and the various equations of motion we encounter, solving the equations numerically, is the standard approach.

<p>
It allows us to focus on the underlying forces. Often we end up using the same numerical algorithm for different problems.

<p>
Here we introduce a commonly used technique that allows us to find the
velocity as a function of position without finding the position as a
function of time&#8212;an alternate form of Newton&#8217;s second law. The method
is based on a simple principle: Instead of solving the equations of
motion directly, we integrate the equations of motion. Such a method
is called an integration method.

<p>
This allows us also to introduce the <b>work-energy</b> theorem. This
theorem allows us to find the velocity as a function of position for
an object even in cases when we cannot solve the equations of
motion. This introduces us to the concept of work and kinetic energy,
an energy related to the motion of an object.

<p>
And finally, we will link the work-energy theorem with the principle of conservation of energy.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="the-work-energy-theorem">The Work-Energy Theorem </h2>

<p>
Let us define the kinetic energy \( K \) with a given velocity \( \boldsymbol{v} \)
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2,
$$

where \( m \) is the mass of the object we are considering.
We assume also that there is a force \( \boldsymbol{F} \) acting on the given object

$$
\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{r},\boldsymbol{v},t),
$$

with \( \boldsymbol{r} \) the position and \( t \) the time.
In general we assume the force is a function of all these variables.
Many of the more central forces in Nature however, depende only on the
position. An example is the gravitational force or the force derived
from the Coulomb potential in electromagnetism.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="rewriting-the-kinetic-energy">Rewriting the Kinetic Energy </h2>

<p>
Let us study the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to time \( t \). Its continuous form is
$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}. 
$$

<p>
Using our results from exercise 3 of homework 1, we can write the derivative of a vector dot product as

$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}= \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}+\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\right)=m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}. 
$$

<p>
We know also that the acceleration
$$
\boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\boldsymbol{F}}{m}=\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}.
$$

<p>
We can then rewrite the equation for the derivative of the kinetic energy as 
$$
\frac{dK}{dt}=m\frac{d\boldsymbol{v}}{dt}\boldsymbol{v}=\boldsymbol{F}\frac{d\boldsymbol{r}}{dt}, 
$$

where we defined the velocity as the derivative of the position with respect to time.
