    "\n",
    "### Monday\n",
    "\n",
    "We try to finalize the discussion we started last Friday on falling objects and numerical aspects thereof.\n",
    "If we get time, we start with a discussion of forces as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended reading: Taylor 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wednesday\n",
    "\n",
    "We revisit Newton's laws and discuss how to analyze a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended reading: Taylor 1.4 and 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Friday\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss several examples and try to wrap up the discussions on Newton's laws.\n",

    "## Basic Steps of Scientific Investigations\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we discussed several basi elements of the scientific method. We repeat them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overarching aim in this course is to give you a deeper\n",
    "understanding of the scientific method. The problems we study will all\n",
    "involve cases where we can apply classical mechanics. In our previous\n",
    "material we already assumed that we had a model for the motion of an\n",
    "object.  Alternatively we could have data from experiment (like Usain\n",
    "Bolt's 100m world record run in 2008).  Or we could have performed\n",
    "ourselves an experiment and we want to understand which forces are at\n",
    "play and whether these forces can be understood in terms of\n",
    "fundamental forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step consists in identifying the problem. What we sketch\n",
    "here may include a mix of experiment and theoretical simulations, or\n",
    "just experiment or only theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying our System\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can ask questions like\n",
    "1. What kind of object is moving\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What kind of data do we have\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do we measure position, velocity, acceleration etc\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which initial conditions influence our system\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other aspects which allow us to identify the system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "With our eventual data and observations we would now like to develop a\n",
    "model for the system. In the end we want obviously to be able to\n",
    "understand which forces are at play and how they influence our\n",
    "specific system. That is, can we extract some deeper insights about a\n",
    "system?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need then to\n",
    "1. Find the forces that act on our system\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduce models for the forces\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify the equations which can govern the system (Newton's second law for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. More elements we deem important for defining our model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving the Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "With the model at hand, we can then solve the equations. In classical mechanics we normally end up  with solving sets of coupled ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations.\n",
    "1. Using Newton's second law we have equations of the type $\\boldsymbol{F}=m\\boldsymbol{a}=md\\boldsymbol{v}/dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We need to  define the initial conditions (typically the initial velocity and position as functions of time) and/or initial conditions and boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The solution of the equations give us then the position, the velocity and other time-dependent quantities which may specify the motion of a given object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not yet done. With our lovely solvers, we need to start thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to ask the big questions. What do our results mean? Can we give a simple interpretation in terms of fundamental laws?  What do our results mean? Are they correct?\n",
    "Thus, typical questions we may ask are\n",
    "1. Are our results for say $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$ valid?  Do we trust what we did?  Can you validate and verify the correctness of your results?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluate the answers and their implications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare with experimental data if possible. Does our model make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. and obviously many other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis stage feeds back to the first stage. It may happen that\n",
    "the data we had were not good enough, there could be large statistical\n",
    "uncertainties. We may need to collect more data or perhaps we did a\n",
    "sloppy job in identifying the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these steps are essential elements in a scientific\n",
    "enquiry. Hopefully, through a mix of numerical simulations, analytical\n",
    "calculations and experiments we may gain a deeper insight about the\n",
    "physics of a specific system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Falling baseball in one dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "We anticipate the mathematical model to come and assume that we have a\n",
    "model for the motion of a falling baseball without air resistance.\n",
    "Our system (the baseball) is at an initial height $y_0$ (which we will\n",
    "specify in the program below) at the initial time $t_0=0$. In our program example here we will plot the position in steps of $\\Delta t$ up to a final time $t_f$. \n",

    "\n",
    "In our investigations we will thus analyze a specific physics problem in terms of the system and the environment.\n",
    "In doing so we need to identify the forces that act on the system and assume that the\n",
    "forces acting on the system must have a source, an identifiable cause in\n",
    "the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A force acting on for example a falling object must be related to an interaction with something in the environment.\n",
    "This also means that we do not consider internal forces. The latter are forces between\n",
    "one part of the object and another part. In this course we will mainly focus on external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact between\n",
    "the system and the environment. Well-known long-range forces are the gravitional force and the electromagnetic force.\n",

    "## Setting up a model for forces acting on an object\n",

    "2. Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Identify the long-range forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting from where the force is acting. The direction of the vector(s) indicates the (positive) direction of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate the relative magnitude of the forces.\n",
