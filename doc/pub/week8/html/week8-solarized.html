<p>
The harmonic oscillator is omnipresent in physics. Although you may think 
of this as being related to springs, it, or an equivalent
mathematical representation, appears in just about any problem where a
mode is sitting near its potential energy minimum. At that point,
\( \partial_x V(x)=0 \), and the first non-zero term (aside from a
constant) in the potential energy is that of a harmonic oscillator. In
a solid, sound modes (phonons) are built on a picture of coupled
harmonic oscillators, and in relativistic field theory the fundamental
interactions are also built on coupled oscillators positioned
infinitesimally close to one another in space. The phenomena of a
resonance of an oscillator driven at a fixed frequency plays out
repeatedly in atomic, nuclear and high-energy physics, when quantum
mechanically the evolution of a state oscillates according to
\( e^{-iEt} \) and exciting discrete quantum states has very similar
mathematics as exciting discrete states of an oscillator.

<h2 id="harmonic-oscillator-deriving-the-equations">Harmonic Oscillator, deriving the Equations </h2>
The potential energy for a single particle as a function of its position \( x \) can be written as a Taylor expansion about some point \( x_0 \)

$$
\begin{equation}
V(x)=V(x_0)+(x-x_0)\left.\partial_xV(x)\right|_{x_0}+\frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^2\left.\partial_x^2V(x)\right|_{x_0}
+\frac{1}{3!}\left.\partial_x^3V(x)\right|_{x_0}+\cdots
\label{_auto1}
\end{equation}
$$

If the position \( x_0 \) is at the minimum of the resonance, the first two non-zero terms of the potential are

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
V(x)&\approx& V(x_0)+\frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^2\left.\partial_x^2V(x)\right|_{x_0},\\
\nonumber
&=&V(x_0)+\frac{1}{2}k(x-x_0)^2,~~~~k\equiv \left.\partial_x^2V(x)\right|_{x_0},\\
\nonumber
F&=&-\partial_xV(x)=-k(x-x_0).
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Put into Newton's 2nd law (assuming \( x_0=0 \)),

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
m\ddot{x}&=&-kx,\\
x&=&A\cos(\omega_0 t-\phi),~~~\omega_0=\sqrt{k/m}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<h2 id="harmonic-oscillator-technicalities">Harmonic Oscillator, Technicalities </h2>

<p>
Here \( A \) and \( \phi \) are arbitrary. Equivalently, one could have
written this as \( A\cos(\omega_0 t)+B\sin(\omega_0 t) \), or as the real
part of \( Ae^{i\omega_0 t} \). In this last case \( A \) could be an
arbitrary complex constant. Thus, there are 2 arbitrary constants
(either \( A \) and \( B \) or \( A \) and \( \phi \), or the real and imaginary part
of one complex constant. This is the expectation for a second order
differential equation, and also agrees with the physical expectation
that if you know a particle's initial velocity and position you should
be able to define its future motion, and that those two arbitrary
conditions should translate to two arbitrary constants.

<p>
A key feature of harmonic motion is that the system repeats itself
after a time \( T=1/f \), where \( f \) is the frequency, and \( \omega=2\pi f \)
is the angular frequency. The period of the motion is independent of
the amplitude. However, this independence is only exact when one can
neglect higher terms of the potential, \( x^3, x^4\cdots \). Once can
neglect these terms for sufficiently small amplitudes, and for larger
amplitudes the motion is no longer purely sinusoidal, and even though
the motion repeats itself, the time for repeating the motion is no
longer independent of the amplitude.

<p>
One can also calculate the velocity and the kinetic energy as a function of time,

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{x}&=&-\omega_0A\sin(\omega_0 t-\phi),\\
\nonumber
K&=&\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2=\frac{m\omega_0^2A^2}{2}\sin^2(\omega_0t-\phi),\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{k}{2}A^2\sin^2(\omega_0t-\phi).
\end{eqnarray}
$$

<h2 id="harmonic-oscillator-total-energy">Harmonic Oscillator, Total Energy </h2>

<p>
The total energy is then

$$
\begin{equation}
E=K+V=\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2+\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\label{_auto2}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
The total energy then goes as the square of the amplitude.

<p>
A pendulum is an example of a harmonic oscillator. By expanding the
kinetic and potential energies for small angles find the frequency for
a pendulum of length \( L \) with all the mass \( m \) centered at the end by
writing the eq.s of motion in the form of a harmonic oscillator.

<p>
The potential energy and kinetic energies are (for \( x \) being the displacement)

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
V&=&mgL(1-\cos\theta)\approx mgL\frac{x^2}{2L^2},\\
K&=&\frac{1}{2}mL^2\dot{\theta}^2\approx \frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

<p>
For small \( x \) Newton's 2nd law becomes

$$
m\ddot{x}=-\frac{mg}{L}x,
$$

<p>
and the spring constant would appear to be \( k=mg/L \), which makes the
frequency equal to \( \omega_0=\sqrt{g/L} \). Note that the frequency is
independent of the mass.
